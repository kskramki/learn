# Microsoft Graph Training Module - Leveraging the Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK from the SharePoint Framework

This module will introduce you to working with the Microsoft Graph REST API to access data in Office 365 by building a SharePoint Framework client-side web part.

> Note: At the time of publishing this module, the Microsoft Graph client support in the SharePoint Framework is in preview and requires using beta libraries, packages and APIs. When the SPFx releases the Microsoft Graph support to Generally Available (GA), this module will be updated to reflect the latest guidance, libraries and APIs available.
